--- event ticket page - bugs / changes
- no photo - doesn't add to main listings page
- maybe make placeholder example text lighter colour or italics
- maybe don't need price range entry fields, just sort all tickets by price and included highest and lowest
- being able to remove ticket types is a problem if users have already purchased - maybe just change to del flg - but still needs to acknowledge that a ticket has been bought and someone has spent money
